# Plotagon Studio - Installer

## What is Plotagon?
Plotagon is an animation software for your phone or computer that allows you to create 3D animations and grounded videos.

## Running / Installation
To start the installer on Windows, open install_plotagon.bat. It'll automate just about everything for you and, well, install Plotagon Studio. On your first run, you will likely need to right-click it and click "Run as Administrator". This allows it to properly run if there is lag in the software. After your initial run, you shouldn't need to do that again, you can start it as normal.

These are unaffiliated people that they haven't directly done anything for the project (and probably don't even know it exists) but still deserve credit for their things. Kinda like a shoutout but in a project's readme. ***Please do not contact them about Vyond Legacy Offline.***
